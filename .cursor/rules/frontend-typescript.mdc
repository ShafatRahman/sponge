# Frontend TypeScript Standards

## Tooling

- Run `npm run check` to verify typecheck + lint + format in one command.
- Prettier handles formatting. ESLint handles logic errors. Don't fight between them.
- Husky + lint-staged run automatically on commit.

## Patterns

- React components: functional only. No class components.
- Services and API clients: class-based (ApiClient, JobsService, AuthService).
- All API responses validated with Zod schemas in `lib/models/`.
- Use `@/` path alias for imports (maps to project root).

## API Integration

- All API calls go through `ApiClient` singleton (`lib/api/api-client.ts`).
- Request interceptor: attaches Supabase JWT, transforms body to snake_case.
- Response interceptor: transforms response to camelCase, handles 401 refresh.
- Domain services (JobsService) wrap ApiClient with typed methods.

## Styling

- Dark theme by default (Profound-inspired). Colors defined in `globals.css` CSS variables.
- Use shadcn/ui components from `components/ui/`. Add new ones with `npx shadcn add <name>`.
- Tailwind CSS v4. Use `cn()` utility from `lib/utils.ts` for conditional classes.
