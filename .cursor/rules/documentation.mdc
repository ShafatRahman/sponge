# Documentation Standards

## Structure

- `docs/` contains all project documentation, organized by topic:
  - `setup/` -- local development, env vars, Docker
  - `architecture/` -- system design, pipeline, data flow, SSE
  - `technologies/` -- tech stack reference with learning links
  - `deployment/` -- ECS, Vercel, CI/CD, SSM secrets
  - `testing/` -- test structure, running tests, writing new tests
  - `api/` -- REST endpoints, auth, SSE protocol
  - `contributing/` -- code style, git workflow, docs maintenance

## When to Update Docs

- New API endpoint -> `docs/api/endpoints.md`
- Changed SSE behavior -> `docs/api/sse-protocol.md` + `docs/architecture/sse-streaming.md`
- New dependency -> `docs/technologies/` (backend.md, frontend.md, or infrastructure.md)
- Architecture change -> `docs/architecture/overview.md` + relevant sub-file
- New Terraform module -> `docs/deployment/` + `docs/technologies/infrastructure.md`
- Changed env vars -> `docs/setup/environment-variables.md`
- New test patterns -> `docs/testing/README.md`
- Changed Docker setup -> `docs/setup/docker.md`
- Changed rate limits -> `docs/api/endpoints.md` + `docs/api/authentication.md` + `backend/apps/core/models.py` (`RateLimitConfig`)

## Style

- Use tables for structured data (env vars, commands, endpoints).
- Include code examples where they clarify usage.
- Link between docs when referencing related topics.
- Keep each file focused on one topic. Split if a file exceeds ~200 lines.
